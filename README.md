# smart-car
this application we have used hardware Arduino Uno , l298 , servo servo motor , connecting wires , ultrasonic sensor“. We also have used software to code the hardware function , few other software are “Arduino ide".Arduino ide is used to make some decision function to the Arduino hardware with help of input from the ultrasonic sensor kept in front of smart car. The ultrasonic sensor will continuously and both simultaneously gets an input values and transmit the data to the Arduino Uno through pins. The Arduino board is programed as when an obstacle comes the smart car will make an action based on the condition to avoid the accidents
